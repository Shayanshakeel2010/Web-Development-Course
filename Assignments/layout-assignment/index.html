    <h2 class="h-2">Allah is the Creator </h2>

    <p class="para-1">Allah is the One who created the whole universe.
        He made the sky, the earth, the sun, and the stars.
        Every living being exists by His command alone.
        Nothing happens without His will and permission.
        He created us in the best shape and form.
        Truly, Allah is the Creator of everything that exists.</p>

    <h2>Allah is One</h2>

    <p class="para">There is only one true God, and that is Allah.
        He has no partner, no family, and no equal.
        He alone deserves all worship and obedience.
        Believing in His oneness is called Tawheed.
        Every prophet came to teach that Allah is One.
        This belief is the heart of Islam and our faith.</p>

    <h2>Allah is All-Powerful</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah’s power has no limit or boundary.
        He can create anything just by saying “Be.”
        The sun rises and sets by His command.
        The rain falls only when He orders it.
        Nothing in the universe can happen without Him.
        Truly, Allah is powerful over all things.</p>

    <h2>Allah is All-Knowing</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah knows everything, seen and unseen.
        He knows what is in our hearts and minds.
        No secret, thought, or whisper is hidden from Him.
        He knows our past, present, and future perfectly.
        Even the smallest leaf falling is known to Him.
        Indeed, Allah’s knowledge covers everything.</p>

    <h2>Allah is Most Merciful</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah’s mercy is endless and full of love.
        He forgives those who turn to Him sincerely.
        Every blessing we enjoy is a sign of His mercy.
        He is kinder to us than anyone can ever be.
        Even when we make mistakes, He gives us chances.
        Truly, Allah is the Most Kind and Most Forgiving.</p>

    <h2>Allah is the Provider</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah gives food, water, and shelter to all beings.
        He provides for humans, animals, and plants alike.
        Every meal we eat is a gift from His mercy.
        He gives us what we need, not always what we want.
        He tests us sometimes to make our faith strong.
        Indeed, Allah is the best of all providers.</p>

    <h2> Allah is Just</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah never does injustice to anyone.
        He rewards the good and punishes the evil.
        On the Day of Judgment, all will be treated fairly.
        Even a small good deed will not be forgotten.
        His justice is perfect, beyond human understanding.
        Truly, Allah is the Most Fair and Wise Judge.</p>

    <h2>Allah Listens to Prayers</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah listens to everyone’s prayers with love.
        He hears even the silent cries of our hearts.
        When we call on Him, He always responds.
        Sometimes He answers right away, sometimes later.
        Whatever He decides is always for our good.
        He loves those who pray and trust in Him.</p>

    <h2>Allah is Eternal</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah has always existed and will never end.
        He was never born and will never die.
        Everything else in this world will pass away.
        But Allah will remain forever, without any end.
        He is the first and the last, the seen and unseen.
        Truly, Allah is beyond time and space.</p>

    <h2> Allah Loves His Servants</h2>

    <p class="para">Allah loves those who do good and stay humble.
        He blesses the honest, kind, and patient people.
        When we remember Him, He remembers us too.
        His love fills our hearts with peace and comfort.
        He wants us to pray, forgive, and help others.
        Indeed, Allah’s love is the greatest blessing of all.</p>
